/* Originally, I made this simple function */

function isEven(target) {
  if(target % 2 == 0)
    return true;
  else
    return false;
}
console.log(isEven(-2)); // But it's not recursive...I need more help with this problem

/* I tried to implement the || symbol, because it would return to the left when true and 
return to right otherwise. */
